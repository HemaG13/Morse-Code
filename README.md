# Morse-Code
Morse code is a method used in communication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes or dits and dahs, As paralysed people are capable of eye movements, they can give signs like yes or no using eye blink. Then the morse code is converted into text and text to audio.
